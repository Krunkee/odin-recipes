    <h3>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this easy lasagna recipe:<h3>

        <p>The good news is that making turkey burgers from scratch is quite easy. All you need is ground turkey, onion, bread crumbs, eggs, and some seasonings and you're good to go.
            Simply combine your ground turkey, diced onion, bread crumbs, egg whites, garlic, parsley, salt, and ground pepper in a bowl. We recommend sticking with ground turkey that's 
            about 93% lean or less â€” any leaner than that and your burger might fall apart.
            Form the ground turkey mixture into patties and cook the burgers using your preferred method. </p>
